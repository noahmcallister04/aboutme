### Basic Information About Myself:

**Background:** I was born and raised in St. Charles County, which is about an hour from St. Louis. 
I attended Fort Zumwalt West Highschool and took a basic web design and intro to python class. 
I've always known I wanted to do something with computers and technology and I enjoy learning about 
coding and software engineering in my college classes.

**Interests:** As stated before I have always been interested in computers and technology. In middle
school I would experiment in graphic design and video editing and often collaborate with very small
youtube channels to provide them with artwork. Since then I have lost interest in the media side and would like to persue software engineering.

**Where I'm at now:** I am currently a student at Missouri University and my major as of now is Information Technology. In my college classes I have started learning and improving my skills in three programming languages.

1. Python
2. HTML
3. JavaScript

I plan on continuing this path as my major and to hopefully become a software engineer after college.
