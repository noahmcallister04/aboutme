### Basic Information About Myself:

**Background:** I was born and raised in __[St. Charles County](https://www.google.com/maps/vt/data=3CdSwpzA4yn7jto2yfa6tRLIwS3WYJdGvEmB0OxUlFkbVrISAYuXTRo0kZcEFpLDluOyS2vtS1gtW4EapToRT0mwtXOfFzE2BLmUKuWna9Q67gTlpymyFppHJvuAec5dHzXTQ4wPd1gnfvDsSb9YyVm-bKwehmSqOlYqIuZ7jP12OhHmImKmmZS5WGprX15YbqJEYiE_bHuweboz6zWiidLt1yOB3HkI_OiEtymPJOG4TC_PWC0LxxS5)__, which is about an hour from St. Louis. 
I attended Fort Zumwalt West Highschool and took a basic web design and intro to python class. 
I've always known I wanted to do something with computers and technology and I enjoy learning about 
coding and software engineering in my college classes.

**Interests:** As stated before I have always been interested in computers and technology. In middle
school I would experiment in graphic design and video editing and often collaborate with very small
youtube channels to provide them with artwork. Since then I have lost interest in the media side and would like to persue software engineering.

**Where I'm at now:** I am currently a student at __[Missouri University](https://missouri.edu/)__  and my major as of now is Information Technology. In my college classes I have started learning and improving my skills in three programming languages.

1. Python
2. HTML
3. JavaScript

I plan on continuing this path as my major and to hopefully become a software engineer after college.
